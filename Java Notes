NO STRINGS ATTACHED
  
Java provides three classes to represent the sequence of characters i.e. String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder. 
  A string is immutable in Java whereas, both StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable.
  This means they allow modifications to the character sequence without creating new objects.
